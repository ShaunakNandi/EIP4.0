# Achieving 0.9940 accuracy on the MNIST dataset within 20 epochs:

  1. Iteration 1: Vanilla - 1x1(to reduce #params) and MP alone
  
  2. Iteration 2: Intro BN and reduce #param count
  
  3. Iteration 3: A touch of Dropout to furthur reduce overfit (99.40% reached)
  
  4. Iteration 4: Adam vs SGD case study
